# Project Proposal

## Name of Student: Viktoriia Zubarieva

## Name of Project: My recipe book

## Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

"My recipe book" will be recipe organizer app. It will have bright and juicy interface and easy to use and find user's recipes.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

1. Profile for each user
2. User should be able to add recipes, ingredients, photos
3. User can search in their own recipes
4. API with recipes

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

I'm going to use React for user interface logic. Investigate Firebase and Google cloud infrastructure as a possible replacement for backend.

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- User can read another user's recipes
- Add rating to each recipe
- Filter recipes by tags (soups, desserts, salads ... etc.)
- Create shopping list
- Add multiple photos per recipe step
- Make it as a mobile app

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Firebase/Google cloud (I will start research) or another .Net/MySQL

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
